# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines from the local path below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Read the cached guidelines before each review:

```
/home/basil/tmp/frontend/skillsets/wig-command.md
```

Read that local file to retrieve the rules (no network access). The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read guidelines from the local path above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
